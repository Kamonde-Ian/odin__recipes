    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>   
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>  
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li> 
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li> 
        <li>Â½ teaspoon salt</li>  
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li> 
        <li>2 eggs</li>  
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>  
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li> 
        <li>4 tablespoons vegetable shortening, melted and cooled slightly</li> 
        <li>1 cup sifted powdered sugar (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Adjust an oven rack to upper-middle position. Spray a donut pan with cooking spray.</li>    
        <li>Sift flour, sugar, cornstarch, baking powder, nutmeg, and salt together in a large mixing bowl.</li>   
        <li>Whisk buttermilk, eggs, baking soda, and vanilla extract together in a smaller bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour melted and cooled shortening into flour mixture and stir until absorbed. Add buttermilk mixture and mix well. Let batter rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li> 
        <li>Pour a scant tablespoon of batter into the well of each donut cup in the prepared pan. Use the back of a spoon to distribute batter evenly across the bottom of each; you won't use up all of the batter in this batch.</li> 
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven on the upper-middle rack until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven; let cool in the pan for 2 to 3 minutes before removing onto a wire rack.</li> 
        <li>Place powdered sugar into a small paper bag. Toss warm doughnuts in powdered sugar to coat.</li>    
        <li>Spray the donut pan with cooking spray again. Spoon batter in tablespoonfuls into the hot pan for the next batch.</li> 
        <li> Bake donuts in the preheated oven on the upper-middle rack until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool for 2 to 3 minutes before removing from the pan and toss in powdered sugar.</li>   
    </ol>
